        <h2 class="bodytext">A Short History of Time</h2>
        <div class="bodytext">
            Soon after we started in 1999, there was the huge hullabaloo of Y2K which fizzled out.
            We got a few projects and worked diligently, 
            taking each day as it came while keeping an eye on the future.
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            Then the dot-com bust and 9/11 happened.
            The IT/software industry in India saw massive slowdown, 
            and a number of companies shut down. We trudged on.
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            We stabilized and started growing in the mid-2000s again.
            Having survived the early-2000 downturn, we were determined to not let future events affect us.
            Then the 2009 recession hit, we came through unscathed.
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            From a position of doing anything we came across (could start-ups be choosers?), 
            we changed course in 2013. We took a strong stand that we would engage only with quality clients,
            do quality work, and hire quality people.
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            Thus we stand here today, a focused group of dedicated people,
            an organization that proudly chose to stick to its knitting!
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">&nbsp;</div>
        <h2 class="bodytext">Some Spectacular Numbers</h2>
        <div class="bodytext">
            We have a few clients who have been working with us back from when we started (that's 20 years!), 
            and a good number of clients who have worked with and loved us for more than 10 years!
        </div>
        <div class="bodytext">
            We have worked with clients across generations. Seriously, 
            some have spanned generations of a family!
